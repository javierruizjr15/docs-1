# The XNET Token

## Token Basics

As of August 2024, XNET has successfully transitioned to the Solana network. The `$XNET` Token is a Solana SPL Token with a max supply of 2,400,000,000 (two billion, four hundred million) deflationary XNET tokens (`$XNET`). These tokens will be issued gradually over time and be allocated according to the breakdown below.

!!! Warning
    Don't be fooled! Confirm you are using the official Solana `$XNET` token address for all transactions.

## `$XNET` Economics

In order for the XNET network to operate, the economics must work for all participants. The `$XNET` Token unites two groups:

1. Those who build the network's physical infrastructure (node operators mainly), and,
2. Mobile Network Operators who pay to use the footprint created by the deployers.

Node operators, whether they be businesses or individuals, are who earn the `$XNET` Token. Mobile Network Operators are the end user of the XNET Network, and must pay to access XNET whether it be via LTE roaming or Carrier WiFi offload.

!!! Note
    Mobile Network Operators strictly settle in cash, and the XNET Foundation is what bridges the gap between the `$XNET` Token and the world of Fiat dollars. The majority of every dollar of offload revenue will be used by the XNET foundation to buy XNET on the open market then burn, thereby permanently removing the tokens from circulation.

## Earning `$XNET`

Token distribution operates on the *XNET Epoch Schedule*. An Epoch is two weeks long, landing on a Sunday. The very first XNET Epoch was November 28th, 2022. On the first or second day of the new epoch, token distribution takes place and the community of XNET builders received tokens commensurate with the hardware deployed, uptime, data throughput and location.

!!! TIP
    Token rewards will change over time as the network grows and new hardware becomes available. Stay on top of the latest earning rates in the tables below.

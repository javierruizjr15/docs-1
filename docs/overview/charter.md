# XNET Charter

## Decentralization

XNET is committed to decentralization. We believe that the best way to achieve this is by working collaboratively with our community to develop proposals that reflect the needs and priorities of stakeholders.

Over time we will:

- Provide a thorough roadmap for the formation of XNET Foundation DAO, according to our Governance Outline
- Introduce a voting mechanism for changes in token emissions or governance
- Airdrop governance NFT’s to hyper-passionate community members who wish to participate in the formation of our DAO

## Connectivity

XNET is dedicated to solving the connectivity issues faced by global carriers and the underserved. We are committed to providing unparalleled coverage and reliability, ensuring that our network delivers affordable and fast connectivity solutions.

XNET will not deviate from:

- Maintaining GSMA & 3GPP standards for our carrier-grade core
- Building high-quality coverage for Mobile Network Operators (MNO) and Multi-Service Operators (MSO) using a cluster deployment strategy
- Our core mission: connecting the unconnected

## Tokens

The $XNET token will always be connected economically with the XNET network, and we will not deviate from this philosophy.

We are committed to a token allocation that supports our community and empowers our foundation. The XNET token will always be a utility token.

Our insider tokens will start gradually unlocking after 3 years. This ensures the team’s long-term commitment to the XNET project.

## Sustainability

We believe that long-term sustainability is essential for creating a network that can benefit our community and users for years to come. Importantly, we will never deviate from bringing utility to our token as described in the original 2022 white paper, ensuring that our network remains a valuable and reliable asset for our community.

## Equipment Promise

We value our partners and understand that the investment you make in the hardware to power XNET is critical to our success. XNET promises that your equipment is yours and we will never lock it to our network. Should you decide to leave XNET, we will not stand in your way to deregister the radios from SAS and reset the radio to a factory state.

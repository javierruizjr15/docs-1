# XNET Ultra-High Density Location Incentive Program (UHDP)

The **Ultra-High Density Location Incentive Program** (UHDP) by XNET is tailored for ultra-high density venues, e.g. large and mid-size airports, stadiums, arenas and large shopping malls. This program incentivizes partners to operate XNET-enabled Passpoint Wi-Fi networks, delivering high-quality connectivity to locations that serve at least 1,000 mobile subscribers daily.

## Program Benefits

- **Guaranteed Minimum Payment**: qualified venues, upon successful location testing and validation by XNET, receive a predetermined reward based on venue type and anticipated usage.
- **Predictable Earnings**: the minimum payment offers a steady income stream for venue owners, as XNET and its carrier partners increase cellular roaming traffic.
- **Flexible Participation Terms**: venue owners/operators may opt in or out at the end of each XNET epoch with written notice to the XNET UHDP team.

## Key Program Terms

- **Eligibility**: open to ultra-high density U.S.-based networks using Wi-Fi 6, 6E, or 7 technology, with Passpoint 2.
- **Professional Site Deployment and Operation**:
    - Site Validation and Quality Survey: each location must complete a professional validation and quality of service (QoS) survey with XNET’s Passpoint SSID enabled to qualify for UHDP.
    - QoS Documentation: venue owners/operators are responsible for providing QoS survey results to XNET during application and prior to benefit distribution.

- **UHDP Payments**:
    - Payment Structure: UHDP payments are provided in place of offload revenue payments; participating locations are ineligible for other offload or incentive payments until they opt out of UHDP.

## Program Duration and Termination

- **Initial Term**: participation begins with a three-month commitment. UHDP expires automatically after this initial term unless extended by XNET for another three months. The maximum program duration for any venue is six months.
- **Termination Policy**: XNET may terminate a venue’s participation without notice if the site fails to meet QoS standards or does not comply with XNET’s technical performance or security requirements for carrier-grade Wi-Fi operation.

## Application Process

The deployer application follows three easy steps:

- **Express Interest**: to apply, email UHDP@xnetmobile.com The XNET team will review your location’s eligibility and provide additional information on the UHDP.
- **Submit Site Survey**: enable XNET Passpoint SSID on your network and conduct QoS survey according to the criteria provided to you by the XNET UHDP team. 
- **Get Approval**: receive approval and start collecting the UHDP benefits. 

## UHDP Premium Support

- **Dedicated Account Manager**: each partner in UHDP is assigned a dedicated account manager for streamlined communication and support.

- **Priority Technical Support**: access to priority technical support for issue resolution and performance optimization.

## Other Program Terms

- **XNET Foundation Consent**: as part of the internal compliance process involving non-standard reward payments, XNET INC is required to obtain consent and approval from the XNET Foundation for every UHDP agreement. XNET INC reserves the right to deny UHDP applications, if any of the specifically proposed compensation terms have been rejected by the XNET Foundation.

- **Program Modifications**: XNET INC reserves the right to exclude certain venues, amend program terms, or terminate UHDP based on market demand or XNET Foundation directives.
